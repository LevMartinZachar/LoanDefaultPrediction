# LoanDefaultPrediction

This project serves as a proof of concept for an e2e system predicting whether a loan will default or not based on multiple parameters.

The data exploration, preprocessing and the training/evaluation of the model can be found in the `exploration-preprocessing-training.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

The trained model was deployed to Google Cloud Platform, specifically its Vertex AI PredictionService.
